This repository hosts a deep learning project aimed at detecting pneumonia using chest X-ray images. Its main goal is to create an accurate and efficient model that aids in diagnosing pneumonia from medical imaging data.

Features:
Uses CNNs for image classification.
Preprocesses X-ray images, including resizing and normalization.
Incorporates transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models for improved performance.
Provides evaluation metrics like accuracy.
Includes a Streamlit web app for interactive pneumonia prediction with uploaded images.

Technologies:
Python
TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning
Streamlit for web app development
NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib for data handling and visualization
